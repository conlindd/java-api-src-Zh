	 * A servant manager supplies a POA with the ability

	 * a request targeted at an inactive object. A servant 
	 * manager is registered with a POA as a callback object, 
	 * to be invoked by the POA when necessary.
	 * ServantManagers can either be ServantActivators or
	 * ServantLocators. A ServantManager object must be 
	 * local to the process containing the POA objects 
	 * it is registered with.
